            <p>
                An <strong>Interim CTO</strong> is a Chief Technology Officer who leads a business's technology direction on a temporary or part-time basis.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-secondary mt-4">Why Businesses Need Interim CTOs</h3>
            <p>
                Every business needs to constantly upgrade technologically to keep up with the times.
                Falling behind in technology can lead to competitors overtaking you.
                To prevent this, businesses need CTOs. However, most businesses hesitate to hire full-time CTOs due to budget constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>That's where Interim CTOs come in.</em> SMEs often hire them for short-term projects or part-time roles.
                For example:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-group mb-4">
                <li class="list-group-item">4-8 hours per week</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">2 days per month</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-secondary mt-4">Key Responsibilities of an Interim CTO</h3>
            <ul class="list-group mb-4">
                <li class="list-group-item">Recommend technologies that need updating</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Help make technology choices</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Negotiate with service providers</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Review contracts</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Screen out overpriced or unnecessary services</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Provide cyber-security guidance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-secondary mt-4">Choosing the Right Interim CTO</h3>
            <p>
                One major challenge for businesses is understanding technical jargon. Business owners may struggle, even if they're experienced, leading to costly mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's crucial to hire someone trustworthy with proven expertise.
                Pre-negotiate responsibilities, compensation, and time commitments to avoid conflicts of interest.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-success mt-4">Final Recommendations</h4>
            <p>
                For long-term growth and competitiveness, having a <strong>trustworthy, skilled CTO</strong> is vital.
                Even if you don't hire full-time, consult with a part-time CTO regularly for guidance.
